Patients presenting with symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction should be administered aspirin immediately unless contraindicated by known hypersensitivity. Electrocardiographic monitoring must be initiated promptly to assess cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Thrombolytic therapy may be considered in the absence of contraindications when percutaneous coronary intervention is not readily available.
