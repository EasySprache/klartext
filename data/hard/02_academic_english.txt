This research analyzes the political framing evident in congressional debates surrounding the introduction and subsequent abolition of the so-called healthcare copayment. Given that framing is conceptually and methodologically applied inconsistently, a political framing approach was derived. In particular, the conflictual dimension of political framing has heretofore received insufficient scholarly attention.

The investigation demonstrates that the discursive construction of political reality is substantially influenced by strategic framing. Both institutional factors and media amplification effects play a significant role in establishing particular interpretive patterns.
